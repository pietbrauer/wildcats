This is the first app I ever developed that actually made it to the store. Please don't judge me on code I wrote 4-5 years ago (even before I used Git).

## What is this?

Back in the day I was approached by a friend who got a friend who needed an app.
It is an app for the local Handball team they wanted to see some scores from previous games,
Wordpress feed, statistics etc. The only problem was they didn't have an API so I used stupid `UIWebView`s.
But hey it was 2010 so people were ok with that. To feel better I call it an hybrid approach.

This is just an experiment to open source something I am no longer working on.
